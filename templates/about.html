        Hi folks, I am Pratik Karki known around the internet as prertik. 
        I do good programming but mostly I do bad programming. 
        Read my blog to know how not to do programming like me and become better programmer. 
        There’s a saying in Chinese about this but I couldn’t understand the words and 
        can’t search it over the internet.

        tl;dr I am bad developer.
